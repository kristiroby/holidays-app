### Introduction
* Holidays-App is a holiday storage app which allows a user to browse through a database of holidays. A user may also create a holiday, edit/update a holiday, and delete a holiday. When creating and/or updating a holiday, a user may type in the holiday name, description, and/or date. When a user deletes a holiday, the name, description, and date of the holiday are all deleted. This all allows some user flexibility.
